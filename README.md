##Learning Python From Skratch

Learning Python From Skratch is a set of IPython Notebooks to learn Python. 
The Notebooks are written for scientists and engineers who need to solve problems and
consider any time spend on programming as time not spend on solving the problem.
Python is an ideal programming language for people with such a mindset, as it makes
many programmig tasks quick and easy and, probably most importantly, fun.

No prior knowledge of computer programming is assumed. 
Each Notebook covers a specific topic and includes a number of exercises. 
The exercises should take less than 4 hours to complete for each Notebook.

The following Notebooks are available:
