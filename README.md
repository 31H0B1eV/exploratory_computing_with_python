##Python for Exploratory Computing

Lots of books are written on scientific computing, but very few deal with the much more common *exploratory computing* 
(a term coined by Fernando Perez), which represent daily tasks of many scientists and engineers that try to solve problems
but are not computer scientists.
This set of  Notebooks is written for scientists and engineers who want to use Python programming
for exploratory computing, scipting, data analysis, and visualization. 
Python makes
many of these programmig tasks quick and easy and, probably most importantly, fun.

No prior knowledge of computer programming is assumed. 
Each Notebook covers a specific topic and includes a number of exercises. 
The exercises should take less than 4 hours to complete for each Notebook.

The following Notebooks are available (they are under development; more will follow soon):
