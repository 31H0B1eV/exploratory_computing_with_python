##Learning Python From Skratch

Learning Python From Skratch is a set of IPython Notebooks to learn Python. 
The Notebooks are written for scientists and engineers who want to use Python programming
for exploratory computing, scipting, data analysis, and visualization. 
Python makes
many of these programmig tasks quick and easy and, probably most importantly, fun.

No prior knowledge of computer programming is assumed. 
Each Notebook covers a specific topic and includes a number of exercises. 
The exercises should take less than 4 hours to complete for each Notebook.

The following Notebooks are available:
